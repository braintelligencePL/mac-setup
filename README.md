<br>
#### Package Manager - Brew (must have)

- [`https://brew.sh/`](https://brew.sh/)
<br>

- [`https://iterm2.com/`](https://iterm2.com/)
<br>
#### Shells for terminal (good to have)

I use Fish interchangeably with ZSH. I have sentiment for Fish, because it was first thing that I used.
If you're new to this better choice is ZSH, probably.

ZSH: [`https://ohmyz.sh/`](https://ohmyz.sh/) <br>
Install: `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"` <br>

FISH: [`https://fishshell.com/`](https://fishshell.com/) <br>
Install: `brew install fish` <br>
