### ü§î Who this setup is for?

## üõ† Macbook Setup

### ‚öô Package Manager - Brew

### ‚öô Iterm 2 - much better terminal

### ‚öô Shells for terminal

I use Fish interchangeably with ZSH. I have sentiment for Fish, because it was first thing that I used.
If you're new to this better choice is ZSH, probably. Fish has more features from default.

ZSH: [`https://ohmyz.sh/`](https://ohmyz.sh/) <br>
Install : `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"` <br>

2. `brew tap caskroom/versions`
3. `brew cask install java`
4. ```export JAVA_HOME="`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8`"```

### ‚öô IntelliJ Idea - Setup 
1. [x] Enable Annotation Processing
